In workshop 3 I learned how to create a class using private and public members and I learned how to use constructors and destructors to manage dynamic memory.This workshop helped me understand why a safe empty state is important and how it prevents invalid objects from being used in a program.One difficulty I had was working with dynamic memory and pointers. At first I forgot to delete the dynamically allocated memory which caused memory leaks. I also struggled with validating the credit card data properly,especially checking the number ranges and string length. After practicing more, I understood how helper functions can make the code cleaner and easier to read. I also learned how constant member functions protect data from being modified accidentally.Overall, this workshop helped me better understand oop. I think more small examples in class would help make dynamic memory easier to understand for beginners.
